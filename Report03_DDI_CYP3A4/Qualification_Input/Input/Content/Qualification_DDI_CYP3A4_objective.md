This **qualification report** evaluates for the PBPK platform **PK-Sim** (as part of the open systems pharmacology (OSP) suite) the ability to perform simulations with the intended purpose to predict cytochrome P450 3A4 (**CYP3A4**)-mediated drug-drug interactions (**DDI**).

To demonstrate the level of confidence, the predictive performance of the platform for this indented purpose is assessed via a network of PBPK models of selected index CYP3A4 DDI perpetrators (covering the range from strong induction to strong inhibition), and respective sensitive index CYP3A4 victim drugs and a comprehensive dataset from published clinical DDI studies. All PBPK models represent whole-body PBPK models, which allow dynamic DDI simulations in organs expressing CYP3A4. 

The respective *qualification plan* to produce this *qualification report* is transparently provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Qualification-DDI-CYP3A4). The same applies for all presented PBPK models including *evaluation reports* on model building and evaluation of each model (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library).

*Evaluation reports* including descriptions on model building and detailed evaluations of the included models are documented separately (see [Section 1.2](#12-cyp3a4-ddi-network)).

Please refer to the [Appendix](#5-appendix) to learn more details:

- An overview over the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite is given in chapter [Section 5.1](#51-open-systems-pharmacology-suite-osps-introduction)

- [Section 5.2](#52-mathematical-implementation-of-drug-drug-interactions) shows the implementation of the underlying mathematical equations for drug-drug interactions in the OSP suite.

- A detailed general description of the performed qualification workflow (*qualification plan*, *qualification report*, etc.) can be found in chapter [Section 5.3](#53-automatic-re-qualification-workflow).
