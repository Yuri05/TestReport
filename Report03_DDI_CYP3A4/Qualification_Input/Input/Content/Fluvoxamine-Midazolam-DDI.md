The fluvoxamine / midazolam interaction was evaluated using two clinical DDI studies ([Kashuba 1998](#4-references), [Lam 2003](#4-references)).

| 2007 | CYP3A4 | Fluvoxamine / midazolam | Fluvoxamine: titrated to a daily dose of **150** mg (50 mg in the morning (6 a.m.), 50 mg in the evening (8 p.m.))<br />Midazolam: 0.025 mg/kg **iv** single dose, 3 hours after a morning fluvoxamine dose | **Observed data:**<br />Baseline (control) assessment: mean of six measures (every 2 weeks)<br />Phenotyping (fluvoxamine treatment) assessment:  mean of two measures (14 days and 28 days after the start of fluvoxamine treatment), midazolam administered at 9 a.m.<br />**Simulated**: the midazolam dose was administered 3 weeks after the start of fluvoxamine as an approximation of the two observed assessments | [Kashuba 1998](#4-references)  |
