### Sufentanil model

Sufentanil PBPK predictions in children were evaluated using pharmacokinetic (PK) data reported in the following studies: 

- Davis PJ, Cook DR, Stiller RL, Davin-Robinson KA. Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of high-dose sufentanil in infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery. Anesth Analg. 1987 Mar;66(3):203-8.[[Davis 1987](#3-references)]
- Guay J, Gaudreault P, Tang A, Goulet B, Varin F. Pharmacokinetics of sufentanil in normal children. Can J Anaesth. 1992 Jan;39(1):14-20.[[Guay 1992](#3-references)]

The pediatric PBPK model predicted the clearance values of sufentanil observed in pediatric studies reasonably across all available age groups, ranging from 5 months to 8.75 years old. The ratios of mean predicted over observed clearance values are illustrated in the table below as well as in the predicted versus observed clearance ratio plot, showing that most predictions in children were within 2-fold error of observed values.
