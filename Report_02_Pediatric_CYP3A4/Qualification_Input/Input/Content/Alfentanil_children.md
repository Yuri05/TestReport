### Alfentanil model

Alfentanil PBPK predictions in children were evaluated using pharmacokinetic (PK) data reported in the following studies: 

- den Hollander JM, Hennis PJ, Burm AG, Vletter AA, Bovill JG. Pharmacokinetics of alfentanil before and after cardiopulmonary bypass in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery: Part I. J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth. 1992 Jun;6(3):308-12.[[Meistelman 1987](#3-references)]
- Meistelman C, Saint-Maurice C, Lepaul M, Levron JC, Loose JP, Mac Gee K. A comparison of alfentanil pharmacokinetics in children and adults. Anesthesiology. 1987 Jan;66(1):13-6.[[den Hollander 1992](#3-references)]

The pediatric PBPK model predicted the AUC values of alfentanil observed in pediatric studies reasonably across all available age groups, ranging from 3.6 months to 9 years old. The ratios of mean predicted over observed AUC values are illustrated in the table below as well as in the predicted versus observed AUC ratio plot, showing that most predictions in children were within 2-fold error of observed values. Another reported study on alfentanil pharmacokinetics in children [[Goresky 1987](#3-references)] showed systematically higher exposure for most individuals compared to the other herein included studies. This deviation may have been caused by different impact of individual pathophysiology of the target study population, inaccurate in vitro assay-techniques or other study differences.
