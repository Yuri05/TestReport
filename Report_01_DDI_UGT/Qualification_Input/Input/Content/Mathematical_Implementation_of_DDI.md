**DDI modeling: Competitive inhibition** 

A detailed representation of the mathematical implementation of competitive enzyme inhibition  can be found in the OSP manual [here](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/pk-sim-compounds-defining-inhibition-induction-processes#competitive-inhibition-simple-setting-with-one-inhibitor).



**DDI modeling: Mechanism-based inhibition**

A detailed representation of the mathematical implementation of mechanism-based enzyme inhibition  can be found in the OSP manual [here](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/pk-sim-compounds-defining-inhibition-induction-processes#irreversible-inhibition).
